# js-macaroon

A javascript implementation of [macaroons](http://theory.stanford.edu/~ataly/Papers/macaroons.pdf),
compatible with the [Go implementation](http://github.com/go-macaroon/macaroon)
and the [Python and C implementations](https://github.com/rescrv/libmacaroons),
and including functionality to interact with third party caveat dischargers
implemented by the [Go macaroon bakery](http://github.com/go-macaroon-bakery/macaroon-bakery).

Currently implemented in YUI module only, but that's only a temporary limitation.
In order to use this, manual loading of tweetnacl and sjcl modules is required.
